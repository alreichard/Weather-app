# Weather-app

# About
This projects main premise was for me to become more comfortable with Api systems. It added together many aspects that I have learned over the past few weeks, aswell. It required bootstrap work to completely design the layout. It also required many new elements to be created, and work with funtions and buttons. I made this app to test how to create a working front end page with a data source as large as the open weather api.
