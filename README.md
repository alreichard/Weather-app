# Weather-app


# about
I created this project to become more comfortable with apis. Using such a large data set, such as the open weather api, allowed me to grow more familiar with maneuvering through these data sets. calling one subset of the data base inside of the other to get the correct information also allowed me to fully understand the ajax object. The website itself also required me to use all of the other skills I have aquired sofar to complete a full front-end website.
